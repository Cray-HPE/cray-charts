# Cray Helm Charts

Central internal [Helm charts](https://helm.sh/) at Cray

* [`stable`](stable/): charts considered stable and releasable
* [`incubator`](incubator/): charts in-progress, not considered ready for release

If you're looking to build out a chart for your service, look instead at [the Cray service generator](https://stash.us.cray.com/projects/CLOUD/repos/cray-generators/browse). It will help you get set up in your service repo with an appropriate chart.

## Testing charts here and elsewhere

Please see the [cray-chartsutil](https://stash.us.cray.com/projects/CLOUD/repos/cray-chartsutil/browse) for more info on testing out charts.

# Gatekeeper Policy Manager(GPM)

Gatekeeper Policy Manager is a simple read-only web UI for viewing OPA Gatekeeper policies' status in a Kubernetes Cluster.

It can display all the defined Constraint Templates with their rego code, and all the Contraints with its current status, violations, enforcement action, matches definitions, etc.
